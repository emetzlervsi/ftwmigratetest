# October 2019 (v2.1.0)

## Notable fixes
* Fixed issue with using comma delimited inbox addresses. Connector returned by launcher now uses the first address in the list.
* Fixed `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN` not serializing properly in JSON
* Fixed deserialization of VI server references
* Fixed an issue that would cause JSON array parsing to recurse endlessly on an incoming error

## CSV serialization
* `FTW-CSV-Variant-Serialize.vi` works much like its JSON counterpart
* `FTW-CSV-Variant-Headers.vi` will scrape labels to be used as a header string
* Delimiter input allows for other delimiters like `\t`

## New methods
* `FTW-File-AppendStringToFileName.vi` appends string to end of file name before extension
* `FTW-File-AppendTimestampToFileName.vi` appends timestamp to end of file name before extension and allows for time formatting options (some may not be file path compatible)
* `FTW-Actor-AddJob-NextConditional.vi`
* `FTW-STR-Array-Delimit-Comma.vi` since most usage is comma
